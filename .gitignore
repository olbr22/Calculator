############
#Explanation:

    #build/ and */build/: Ignores build directories where compiled files are stored.
    #.idea/ and related files: Ignores Android Studio's project-specific settings and configurations.
    #local.properties: Contains local environment settings, such as the SDK location, which may differ from machine to machine.
    #Keystore and signing files: These are used to sign your app for publishing. They are sensitive files that should not be publicly shared.
    #Log, APK, and lock files: Temporary files that don't need to be version-controlled.
    #Operating system files: Ensures OS-specific files, like Windows Thumbs.db, are not included.
